            <h2>Malware Infection</h2>
            <p>You download a free game or a software tool from the internet, but soon after installing it, your computer starts running slowly. Strange pop-up ads appear, and your web browser redirects you to random websites. This is likely caused by malware, a harmful software that can spy on you, steal your data, or damage your computer. Malware often hides in files you download from unofficial or unsafe websites. It can even track your keystrokes, steal passwords, or access your personal files without your knowledge. Sometimes, malware can turn your device into part of a "botnet"—a network of computers used to launch cyberattacks. Protect yourself by downloading software only from trusted sources, using security software, and avoiding clicking on suspicious links or ads.</p>
            <h3>What happens:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The malware starts spying on your activities and stealing sensitive information like passwords.</li>
                <li>It may install additional harmful programs or create backdoors for further attacks.</li>
                <li>Your computer might become part of a larger botnet, contributing to cyberattacks without your knowledge.</li>
                <li>Personal data, such as financial information, could be at risk of being stolen.</li>

            <h2>Smartphone Loss or Theft</h2>
            <p>You lose your smartphone, or it gets stolen. Along with losing the device itself, all the sensitive information stored on it is at risk. This includes contacts, emails, photos, and even access to your banking apps. If your phone isn't protected by a password or biometric lock, the thief can easily access your private data. Worse yet, if you haven’t set up features like remote wiping, they could steal sensitive financial or personal information. To safeguard yourself, always enable a strong password or fingerprint lock on your phone, enable remote tracking and wiping, and regularly back up your data. This way, if your phone is lost or stolen, you can minimize the damage.</p>
            <h3>What happens:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Without a strong password or biometric lock, the thief can easily access your personal data.</li>
                <li>They could gain access to your bank account and perform unauthorized transactions.</li>
                <li>Sensitive information like contacts, emails, and even your location history is at risk.</li>
                <li>If the phone is not wiped remotely, the thief could impersonate you and exploit your online identity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Understand data exposure:</strong> Identify what sensitive information could be exposed on the lost or stolen smartphone.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn remote security actions:</strong> Explore what actions you can take remotely to protect your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan for future prevention:</strong> Think about steps to prevent this from happening again.</li>

            <h2>Social Media Got Hacked</h2>
            <p>You use the same password for multiple online accounts—your email, social media, and banking—for convenience. One day, you hear that one of the accounts you use has been breached, and hackers now have your email and password. Because you reused the same password, the hackers can now try logging into your other accounts and gain access. This is a password reuse vulnerability. To protect yourself, avoid using the same password across multiple accounts, and always create strong, unique passwords for each one. Using a password manager can help you keep track of different passwords. Enabling two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection.</p>
            <h3>What happens:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The hackers attempt to log into your other accounts using the same email and password.</li>

                <li>They could perform unauthorized transactions, send phishing emails, or steal your data.</li>
                <li>If you don't act quickly to change your passwords, your online security could be at risk.</li>

                <li><strong>Secure compromised accounts:</strong> Once you've understood how the breach happened, your next step is to secure your social media account.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore password management:</strong> Learn about effective password management techniques.</li>

            <h2>USB Drive Malware Scenario</h2>
            <p>You find a USB drive in the parking lot of your place and decide to plug it into your computer, hoping to return it to its owner. However, instead of finding useful information, your computer becomes infected with malware hidden on the USB drive. The malware may give hackers access to your company’s network, compromising sensitive data. This is a USB drive malware attack. Hackers often leave infected USB drives in public places, knowing someone will likely pick them up and use them. To avoid this, never plug unknown USB drives into your computer. Always use trusted sources for storage devices and ensure your system’s antivirus software is up to date.</p>
